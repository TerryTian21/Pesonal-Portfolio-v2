FRAMER MOTION

Srolling Animation
- PROMPT: 

	How would you apply the motion.div animation effect to divs as a user scrolls up and down a page. For example as a user scrolls down the page, the content in the current div fades out.

- Change the sidebar to diamonds that indicate which div a user is on
- Have a fade-in/fade-out animation as user changes divs
- Have text load in as the user scrolls
